# Envuru
**En**gine in **Vu**lkan and **Ru**st

The library I created for my personal projects with 3D rendering needs.  
I add features following my needs in the projects using the library. There's still a lot to do.  
The main contains a demo scene. The library itself is packaged as a "lib" crate-type named envuru.
